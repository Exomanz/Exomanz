# Exo (they/them)
19-year-old college student and hobbyist developer; currently studying Computer Support and Network Administration

I got into C# development in late 2020, and have been mostly making mods and tools for Beat Saber since then. Some of my most notable projects include [UITweaks](https://github.com/Exomanz/UITweaks) and [MenuSaberColors](https://github.com/Exomanz/MenuSaberColors). 

## Commissions
Got an awesome idea for a mod? Let's talk!
You can find all of my commission info (TOS, Pricing, etc) [here](https://github.com/Exomanz/BSCommissionInfo)!

## Support Me:
I make these mods voluntarily and during my free time. If you enjoy what I make and want to see more content from me in the future, consider supporting me on Ko-fi. Every little bit helps! <3
