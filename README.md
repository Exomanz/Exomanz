# Exo
20-year old college student and hobbyist developer; currently studying Computer Support and Software Development

I got into C# development in late 2020 and have been mostly making mods and tools for Beat Saber since then. Some of my most notable projects include [UITweaks](../../../UITweaks), [BetterStaticLights](../../../BetterStaticLights) and [MenuSaberColors](../../../MenuSaberColors). 

## Support Me:
I make these mods voluntarily and during my free time. If you enjoy what I make and want to see more content from me in the future, consider supporting me on Ko-fi. Every little bit helps! <3
